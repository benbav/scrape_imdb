need to get show data and average show info into here



need to fix hardcoded hash
then add more chichi fields
might need to manually go in and get the hash - right now waitinf ro see more info on breaking bad not found
- seems to be logging me out

- try again later since im getting capcha using vnc viewer

- i think you need to go in and solve hte capcha 
Please could you include these fields:

title, user_rating, year, genres, platform, description

i think once we get main export working we have to have seperate requests for description and platform, meaning we need to get hash for each first
