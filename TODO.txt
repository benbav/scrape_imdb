need to fix hardcoded hash - ok i kinda fi

use text.ipynb file
still need to bug fix get_platform_data, then go and get get_ratings_data



title, user_rating, year, genres, platform, description

i think once we get main export working we have to have seperate requests for description and platform, meaning we need to get hash for each first
